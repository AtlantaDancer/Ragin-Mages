# Offline-first JavaScript Game

This is a [Phaser 3](https://phaser.io/) game that is being collaboratively built as part of the 2018 Grow with Google Scholarship: Mobile Web Udacity course.


## Installing

This project requires [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/).

It is recommended that you use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) to install and manage dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

## Running

The following command will build the game and launch a browser in live-edit mode:

```bash
gulp serve
```

When this server is running, any modifications to files in the `./src` folder will automatically trigger a build and a page reload.

To build the game without running a server you can run:

```bash
gulp build
```
